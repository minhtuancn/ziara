Ziara
=====

It's a (very basic) trip planner I made in order to plan my personal journey to canada in 2015.

Ziara is Swahili for "tour".

## Notice

It is still unde construction. (started 14.11.2014)

I created this project in a rush and for fun. It is supposed to run under a normal wamp server (Apache), but I really want to develop it further, using nginx.

I could have used an existing framework, but for this little project I wanted to create something really light and test my PHP abilities, so I decided to create my own PHP environment for routing and controling the app. I sure was inspired by Laravel.

## Notice to myself

- Add a `Vagrantfile` with nginx config.
